ackend Debugging Checklist (json-server)
Since the "backend" is a lightweight json-server verifying 
db.json
, debugging focuses on the process state, data file integrity, and HTTP connectivity.

1. Process & Port Verification
 Terminal Check:
Ensure npm run dev:full is running.
Look for "Hi!" or "Runnning on http://localhost:3001" in the terminal output.
Issue Sign: If you see EADDRINUSE: 3001, an old process is stuck.
Fix: kill $(lsof -t -i:3001)
 Port Status:
Check if port 3001 is listening: lsof -i :3001
Check response manually: curl -I http://localhost:3001/inquiries
Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK (or similar).
If Connection refused: Server is down.
If Empty reply from server: Process exists but is hanging/crashing (Critical issue found during TestSprite).
2. Data Integrity (
db.json
)
 JSON Syntax:
Open 
db.json
.
Ensure it is valid JSON (no trailing commas, all keys quoted).
Structure: It must start with an object, e.g., { "inquiries": [ ... ] }. If it is an array [...] at the root, json-server usage differs.
 Write Permissions:
Ensure the file is not Read-Only.
Ensure the user running npm has write access to the folder.
3. Data Consistency & Logic
 ID Conflicts: json-server usually handles string/number IDs. Ensure manual edits haven't introduced duplicate IDs.
 Empty State:
If 
db.json
 is { "inquiries": [] }, GET request should return [] (200 OK), not 404.
4. API Testing Commands (Manual)
Run these in a separate terminal to isolate backend from frontend issues.

GET (Read):
curl -v http://localhost:3001/inquiries
POST (Create):
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","content":"Debug","author":"Admin","isSecret":false,"createdAt":"2026-01-01","status":"pending"}' \
  http://localhost:3001/inquiries
DELETE (Remove):
# Replace 'ID_HERE' with a real ID from the GET step
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/inquiries/ID_HERE
5. Middleware/CORS Check
json-server enables CORS by default.
If requests fail from localhost:5173 (frontend) but pass from curl, it might be a browser-specific network restriction or mixed-content issue (unlikely on localhost).
